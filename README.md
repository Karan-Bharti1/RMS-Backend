# RMS Backend

This is the backend for the **Resource Management System (RMS)** â€” a Node.js and Express-based API that handles user authentication, project assignments, and resource allocations. The backend connects to MongoDB and provides RESTful endpoints.

## ðŸš€ About Me
Hi there! ðŸ‘‹.
I am currently learning Full Stack Web Development with a focus on the MERN stack (MongoDB, Express.js, React, and Node.js). I'm passionate about building dynamic, user-friendly web applications and continuously improving my skills.

## Features

- User Authentication (Login/Registration)
- Project and Assignment Management
- MongoDB integration using Mongoose
- CORS enabled for frontend communication
- Modular structure using `routes` and `models`

## Technologies Used

- Node.js
- Express.js
- MongoDB with Mongoose
- dotenv
- cors
- bcrypt (if used for hashing)
- jsonwebtoken (JWT-based authentication)

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites

- Node.js (v16+)
- MongoDB (local or Atlas)
- npm or yarn

### Installation

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/RMS-Backend-main.git
cd RMS-Backend-main
npm install
```

### Environment Setup

Create a `.env` file in the root directory and add the following:

```env
PORT=5000
MONGODB=mongodb://localhost:27017/your-db
JWT_SECRET=your_jwt_secret_key
```

### Run the App

```bash
npm start
```

The server should start at `http://localhost:5000`.

### ðŸ§  AI Assistance

This project was developed with the help of **AI tools** to accelerate learning and productivity. Specifically:

- **ChatGPT by OpenAI** was used for:
  - Generating boilerplate code for Express/MongoDB routes
  - Designing REST API structures
  - Debugging errors and optimizing logic
  - Writing Markdown documentation (like this `README.md`)
  - Getting quick references during full stack development

AI assistance was used **as a productivity tool**, but all logic was **understood and integrated manually** by the developer to meet the learning goals and technical requirements of the project.

> **Note:**
